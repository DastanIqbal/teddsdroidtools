Tedd's Droid Tools
==================
Migrated from Google Code SVN repo to GitHub .git repo November '12.

My first published Android app which did two things:

  * answered the phone by pressing the camera button
  * put a screen guard up during an on-going call to prevent cheek hangups

The answer feature was nerfed by Google in Android 2.3.  The permission required to modify the phone state (i.e. answer an incoming call) was changed from anyone being able to use to only those applications installed in the original system ROM being able to use it.  In otherwords only manufacturers, carriers, Google or authors of ROM's for rooted phones could now use it.  Kinda sucked but was a fun project to work on.

The screen guard feature is still helpful to some folks and I may fork the project off to a screen guard only app.
